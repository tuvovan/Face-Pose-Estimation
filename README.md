# Face-Pose-Estimation

## Description
This work is referenced from many sources. My intension was firstly developing the Facebook Messenger Filter (for fun and for further understanding the pose estimation of the face).
Basically this work estimates the pose (yaw, pitch and roll) by Face landmarks(left eye, right eye, nose, left mouth, right mouth and chin). Roll:+90°：-90°/Pitch:+90°：-90°/Yaw:+90°：-90°.

There is a sunglasses part that I added to try as the filter but unfortunately it didn't work really properly. Will try to fix it.
